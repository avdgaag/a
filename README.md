# a -- my personal toolbelt

This is my personal collection of shell scripts and miniprograms that I don't
want to clutter up my shell configuration files.

All programs are stored under `./libexec`. To install, clone and then run `a
init`.

This project is based on 37signals' [sub][] project. Also see [my dotfiles][].
